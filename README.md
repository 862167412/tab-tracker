# Tab Tracker
A Vue.js / Express.js web application for keeping track of guitar tabs

# Setup

You need to have Node Js installed: https://nodejs.org/en/

I suggest you install the following that I use in the video:

VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/
ITerm2: https://www.iterm2.com/ (Mac Only)
Git: https://git-scm.com/

### Client - Terminal A
```
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

### Server - Terminal B
```
cd server
npm install
npm start
```
